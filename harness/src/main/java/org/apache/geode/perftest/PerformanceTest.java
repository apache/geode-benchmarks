/**
 * A declarative performance test. Users should implement
 * this interface and define their test using the passed in
 * {@link TestConfig} object.
 *
 * There are three phases to the test:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Before Tasks - executed sequentially before the test</li>
 * <li>Workload Tasks - executed in parallel repeatedly during the workload phase</li>
 * <li>After Tasks - executed sequentially after the test</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each of these phases can be assigned to *roles*.
 *
 * The test should, at a minimum
 *
 * Define the roles by calling {@link TestConfig#role(String, int)}
 * Define one or more tasks by calling {@link TestConfig#before(Task, String...)},
 * {@link TestConfig#after(Task, String...)} or
 * {@link TestConfig#workload(BenchmarkDriver, String...)}
